# Negative Words Analyzer (How to deal with online negativity)

I created this simple app to scan the titles of news websites before visit them and see if it's worth it.

Negative news impact on our mental health and we need to be very selective.

You can build your own list of negative words simply by editing neg.txt

This app was built for personale use with Python3 (+plugin), HTML, CSS, PHP.

You can do anything you want with it.
