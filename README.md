# Negative Words Analyzer (How to deal with online negativity)

I created this simple app to scan the titles of news websites before visit them and see if it's worth it.

Negative news impact on our mental health and we need to be very selective.

Researchers and scientists report many dangerous effects of reading negative news (not only on social media), such as: anxiety, depression, delinquency, information overload, lack of online safety, invasion of privacy, deception, conflict with others and more.

You can build your own list of negative words editing neg.txt

This app was built with Python3, HTML, CSS.
