# Negative Words Analyzer (How to deal with online negativity)

I created this simple app to scan the titles of italian news websites before visit them and see if it's worth it.

Negative news impact on our mental health and we need to be very selective.

Researchers and scientists report many dangerous effects of reading negative news (not only on social media), such as: anxiety, depression, information overload, lack of online safety, invasion of privacy, deception, conflicts and more.

<h2>Technical details</h2>

You can build your own list of negative words editing the file neg.txt

This app was built with Python3, HTML, CSS.

If you don't have a personal server, you can buy a basic plan of <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">Python Anywhere</a> (Free plan blocks websites scan).

<h2> How to use the app</h2>

- Insert the URL of the site
- Insert the number of the titles to analyze (if you insert 10, only the first 10 titles will be analyzed).
